#summary short description on how to use jigg

= Introduction =

This page should give you a short overview, some examples and links.

= Overview =

You can read the Basic Concepts of the digg.com API [http://apidoc.digg.com/BasicConcepts here]. In a nutshell, you have to call some URL like `http://services.digg.com/stories...` and you'll get the answer (among other formats) as XML. *Jigg* wraps this nicely and provides methods for all the API endpoints so you don't have to build an URL, parse the response and handle http errors etc.

= Examples =

First of all you have to construct a jigg object. 

{{{
Jigg jigg = new Jigg("http://www.thesuntoucher.de");
}}}

== Stories ==
{{{
for (Story story : jigg.getStories(new Topic("Apple", "apple"))) {
 System.out.println(story.getTitle());
}
}}}
